# Hi there, I'm Arpit Mishra! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a student from India and an amateur coder who enjoys creating cool stuff in my spare time. I primarily work on my own, experimenting with different projects and ideas. 

## Skills

- Python: My preferred language and the one I am most proficient in. I love using Python for various projects, from simple scripts to more complex applications.
- Java: Although I'm not as skilled in Java as I am in Python, I still enjoy coding in it and continue to learn and improve my skills.

## Projects

I am constantly working on new projects and trying to improve my coding abilities. Some of my recent projects include:

- VocalEase: A Python GUI application that converts text to speech and vice versa, with options to save the converted files. It includes a translation feature that supports Indian languages.
